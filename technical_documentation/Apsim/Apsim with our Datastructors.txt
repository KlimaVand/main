If you're going to define your own data structure then there are a few steps:


1. The structure needs to be defined in c:\Apsim\Model\DataTypes\DataTypes.xml. 

2. This then gets converted to c# source code by running the batch file: c:\Apsim\Model\DataTypes\DataTypes.bat. For this batch file to work though, you will need FORTRAN compilers. If you're only interested in .NET then you can run the tool manually: 
               C:\Apsim\Model\processdatatypesinterface.exe DataTypes.xml CSDOTNETDataTypes.macro
from a command prompt in the datatypes directory. This should create a file called c:\Apsim\Model\DataTypes\DOTNETDataTypes.cs. 

3. This file gets included in: C:\Apsim\Model\CSDotNetComponentInterface\CSDotNetComponentInterface.sln which as a result will need recompiling.
