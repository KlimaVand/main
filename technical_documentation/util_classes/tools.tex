\chapter{Tools}
In this chaper we will go trough some technical tools that has been developed for Fasset.
\section{Makefile}
We have created a makefile for easy compeleation of Fasset where mashines already have g++ and make setup
\section{Deb creating}
We have created nesesary files and setup scrip for createing deb-package for Debian and Ubuntu.
\section{check of standartBuilding}
We have create a tool for checking standartBuilding.dat if it contains dublicate entry (eg where name and alias match)
\section{lcov}
We have developed a few script that help us with confiureing of Lcov
\section{multicore Fasset}
We dhave developed a program that splits the system.dat into more instances and a bat-script that will launch decent amount of instances of Fasset. This will speed up fasset if you have more cores in you computer and you want to run more that one scenarie of Fasset
\section{Random input files}
We have a small program that can generate some of Fassets input files with random numbers. It can be used if you want to analyse fasset with a lot of data and you dont  wonna generate them youself.
\section{Compare output files}
We have created a tool that compares 2 sets of output of fasset and see how different they are. It can assist you if you have create something in fasset that should not have any sideeffect
\section{Change names}
Since Linux is case sensitive and some of the exel spreadsheet does create files with a wrong name (eksample fields.f02 instead of Fields.f02) we have create a script that renames them
